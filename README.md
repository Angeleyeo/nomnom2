'Rabbeats' is an Android/iOS application targetted at youths struggling with disordered eating. 

# Our Inspiration:
With the prevalation of social media and the uprising use of technology, especially from a young age, youths are at-risk of developing eating disorders. Eating disorders are growing in prevalence in Singaporeâ€™s society, especially among adolescents (Oh & Davis, 2020). According to a study with 797 participants, 19.5% of Singaporeans faced a high risk of suffering from eating disorder (Chua et al, 2020). Amids COVID-19 pandemic, the number of eating disorder cases has increased by 15% in eating disorder cases compared to the previous year.

# Objective:
- Inculcating better eating habits among youths
- Prevent youths from developing eating disorders
- Encourage youths with eating disorders to seek help/provide support
- Support people with eating disorders in developing better eating habits 

# Our Solution:
'Rabbeats' has 5 main functions that are still in progress. 
1. 'How Are You' is a mood/habit tracker that will aid in identifying any potential triggers of eating disorders
2. 'AHA' is a function where users can find purposeful articles that focuses on debunking current stigma and assumptions about eating disorders
3. 'Weekly Chart' is a dashboard allowing users to view their daily symptoms log
4. 'Connect' allows users to connect with health professionals
5. 'Food Options' is a collaborative platform with various dining companies to encourage users' healthy relationship with food

###### Note: We started developing the home page, 'How Are You' and 'Weekly Chart' during the Hackathon. However, we are planning to continue developing and further improving our application in future.
